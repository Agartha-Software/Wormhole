- **Test Steps:**
  1. Get access to the wormhole documentation and installation page
  2. Create a network
  3. Create a second pod on the same machine, connected to the first
  4. (For advanced users) Create a third instance on the same local area network, and connect it to the others
  5. Test that all instances are properly connected by adding a blank file to the network
- **Expected Outcome:** The user doesn't need to consult any external resources for installation, and has a functional network

## **5. Conclusion**
This **Beta Test Plan** for Wormhole describes the essential steps for testing core functionality across different user roles and scenarios. By involving a variety of testers (Mac users, Windows users, home servers, professional engineers and developers), we aim to gather comprehensive feedback on usability, stability and performance. The success criteria defined will enable us to assess whether Wormhole is ready for a wider release. Resolving known issues and limitations during the beta phase will be crucial to delivering a robust, user-friendly product. We hope that the insights gained from these tests will guide final adjustments and ensure that Wormhole meets the high expectations of our users.
