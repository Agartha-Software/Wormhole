## **2. Beta Testing Scenarios**
### **2.1 User Roles**
[Define the different user roles that will be involved in testing, e.g., Admin, Regular User, Guest, External Partner.]

| **Role Name**  | **Description** |
|---------------|---------------|
| **Mac user**       | Allow us to have some insight on the mac experience, bugs unique to mac. A mac user is also used to easy to use interface so we might have usefull API feedback. |
| **Home server user**       | A home server user with a large catalogue of files, so wa can have a real insight of how our system handle realistic hight work load. We could do speed tests and comporate to other filesystems to verify efficiency. |
| **Professionnal engineer**       | API Feedback from experienced user, Point of vue from a professionnal. Working with a professionnal will allow us to have feedback with the interest of company in mind. It will also let us work with someone with professional experience so a wider skill set. |
